**Vaada — Keep Your Promise**

**Effective Date:** February 16, 2026
**Last Updated:** February 19, 2026

Welcome to Vaada (https://vaada.io), operated by Vaada ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using our platform, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use Vaada.

---

## 1. Overview of the Platform

Vaada is a **skill-based fitness commitment platform** that allows users to stake cryptocurrency (USDC) on personal fitness goals. Users commit to achieving measurable fitness outcomes — such as daily step counts (via Fitbit) or distance milestones (via Strava) — over a defined period. Users who meet their goals receive their stake back plus a proportional share of forfeited stakes from users who did not meet their goals.

**Vaada is not gambling.** Outcomes on Vaada are determined entirely by the user's own physical activity and effort. Users have full control over whether they achieve their stated fitness goals. Vaada operates skill-based commitment contracts, similar in nature to platforms like StepBet, DietBet, and other fitness accountability services.

## 2. Eligibility

To use Vaada, you must:

- Be at least **18 years of age**
- Have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement
- Not be a resident of any jurisdiction where participation in skill-based commitment contracts or use of cryptocurrency is prohibited
- Not be on any government sanctions list (OFAC, EU, UN, or equivalent)

By using Vaada, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements.

## 3. Account Registration and Authentication

Vaada uses **Privy** for authentication. You may sign in via email, Google account, or cryptocurrency wallet. You are responsible for:

- Maintaining the security of your authentication credentials
- All activity that occurs under your account
- Ensuring your connected fitness accounts (Fitbit, Strava) accurately reflect your own personal activity

You may not create multiple accounts, impersonate others, or use automated means to generate fitness data.

## 4. How Vaada Works

### 4.1 Commitment Contracts

Users join promises by staking USDC on a fitness goal. Goals are verified through connected fitness devices and apps (Fitbit for steps, Strava for distance/miles).

### 4.2 Outcomes

- **Winners** (users who keep their promise): Receive their original stake back, plus a proportional share of the pool of forfeited stakes from users who did not keep their promise.
- **Losers** (users who break their promise): Forfeit their staked USDC. Forfeited stakes are distributed to winners and/or the Vaada treasury.

### 4.3 Claim Window

After a promise is settled, winners have **30 calendar days** to claim their winnings. If winnings are not claimed within 30 days of settlement, **unclaimed funds are forfeited to the Vaada treasury**. Vaada is under no obligation to notify users of pending claims beyond in-app notifications. It is the user's sole responsibility to monitor their promises and claim winnings in a timely manner.

### 4.4 Skill-Based Nature

All outcomes on Vaada are determined by the user's own effort and physical activity. Unlike gambling, there is no element of chance — you control whether you achieve your goal. This is a commitment device designed to help you follow through on fitness intentions.

## 5. Smart Contracts and Blockchain

### 5.1 Non-Custodial Architecture

Vaada uses smart contracts deployed on **Base** (an Ethereum Layer 2 network) to hold and distribute staked funds. Vaada operates on a **non-custodial** basis — we do not hold, control, or have access to your staked funds once they are deposited into a smart contract.

### 5.2 Blockchain Risks

By using Vaada, you acknowledge and accept the following risks:

- **Smart contract risk:** Smart contracts may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or exploits that could result in loss of funds. While we take reasonable measures to audit and secure our contracts, no smart contract is guaranteed to be free of defects.
- **Blockchain risk:** Transactions on Base and Ethereum are irreversible. Network congestion, forks, or protocol changes may affect transaction processing.
- **USDC risk:** USDC is a stablecoin issued by Circle. Vaada has no control over USDC's peg, liquidity, or regulatory status. USDC is not legal tender and is not FDIC-insured.
- **Wallet risk:** You are solely responsible for the security of your cryptocurrency wallet, private keys, and seed phrases. Lost keys cannot be recovered by Vaada.
- **Gas fees:** Interacting with smart contracts may require payment of network gas fees, which are separate from and in addition to your stake.

### 5.3 No Guarantee of Fund Recovery

Once funds are deposited into a Vaada smart contract, distribution is governed by the contract's code. Vaada cannot reverse, modify, or override smart contract execution except as explicitly coded into the contract's logic.

## 6. Onchain Receipts

### 6.1 Soulbound Receipts

Upon settlement of a promise, Vaada may mint a **non-transferable (soulbound) NFT receipt** to each participant's wallet address. These receipts serve as a permanent onchain record of your commitment — whether kept or broken.

### 6.2 Permanent Record

Receipts are recorded on the Base blockchain and **cannot be deleted, hidden, or transferred**. By participating in a Vaada promise, you consent to having your result (kept or broken) permanently recorded onchain.

## 7. Fitness Data and Verification

### 7.1 Data Sources

Vaada verifies goal completion using data from third-party fitness platforms:

- **Fitbit** — step count data
- **Strava** — distance and activity data

You must connect at least one supported fitness account to participate in promises.

### 7.2 Data Accuracy

You are responsible for ensuring your fitness data is accurate and reflects genuine physical activity. The following are prohibited:

- Manipulating, spoofing, or fabricating fitness data
- Using devices or software to artificially inflate metrics
- Having another person wear your device or complete activities on your behalf
- Manually entering activities (only device-recorded activities count)

Vaada reserves the right to disqualify users and forfeit stakes if fraudulent activity is detected.

### 7.3 Third-Party Services

Fitbit and Strava are independent third-party services. Vaada is not responsible for their availability, accuracy, data handling, or terms of service. Your use of these services is governed by their respective terms and privacy policies.

## 8. Fees

Vaada may retain a percentage of forfeited stakes as a platform fee (treasury allocation). Current fee structures are displayed at the time of promise creation. We reserve the right to modify fees with reasonable notice.

## 9. Prohibited Conduct

You agree not to:

- Use Vaada for money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illegal purposes
- Manipulate or exploit smart contracts in unintended ways
- Create fraudulent fitness data or accounts
- Interfere with the platform's operation or other users' experience
- Circumvent any security measures or access controls
- Use bots, scripts, or automated tools to interact with the platform (except through official APIs)

## 10. Intellectual Property

All content, branding, code, and materials on Vaada (excluding user-generated content and open-source components) are owned by Vaada. You may not copy, modify, or distribute our materials without permission.

## 11. Disclaimers

### 11.1 "As Is" Basis

VAADA IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

### 11.2 No Financial Advice

Vaada does not provide financial, investment, tax, or legal advice. Participation in Vaada promises involves risk of loss. You should consult appropriate professionals before using cryptocurrency or staking funds.

### 11.3 Regulatory Uncertainty

The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency and blockchain-based platforms is evolving. Vaada makes no representations regarding the legality of its services in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for compliance with your local laws.

## 12. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, VAADA, ITS OPERATOR, AND AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR:

- ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES
- LOSS OF FUNDS DUE TO SMART CONTRACT BUGS, EXPLOITS, OR BLOCKCHAIN ISSUES
- LOSS OF FUNDS DUE TO WALLET COMPROMISE OR USER ERROR
- INACCURATE FITNESS DATA FROM THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS
- SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS OR DOWNTIME
- UNCLAIMED WINNINGS FORFEITED AFTER THE 30-DAY CLAIM WINDOW
- ANY DAMAGES EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT YOU STAKED IN THE RELEVANT PROMISE

## 13. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Vaada and its operator from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the platform, violation of these Terms, or infringement of any third party's rights.

## 14. Dispute Resolution

### 14.1 Informal Resolution

Before filing any formal claim, you agree to contact us at **hello@vaada.io** and attempt to resolve the dispute informally for at least 30 days.

### 14.2 Binding Arbitration

Any dispute not resolved informally shall be settled by binding arbitration administered under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Arbitration will be conducted on an individual basis — **class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted**.

### 14.3 Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina, United States, without regard to conflict of law principles.

## 15. Modifications

We may update these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated via the platform or email. Continued use of Vaada after changes constitutes acceptance.

## 16. Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to Vaada at any time, for any reason, with or without notice. Upon termination, any pending promise stakes will be handled according to the applicable smart contract logic. The 30-day claim window remains in effect for any settled promises at the time of termination.

## 17. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.
